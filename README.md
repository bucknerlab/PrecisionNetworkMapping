# Introduction
This pipeline is designed to estimate individual-specific brain networks using a 15-network Multi-Session Hierarchical Bayesian Model (MS-HBM). This pipeline has been used to estimate organization of the cerebral cortex ([Du et al., 2024 J Neurophysiol](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00308.2023), the cerebellum ([Saadon-Grosman et al., 2024 Sci Adv](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq4037)), the striatum ([Kosakowski et al., 2024 J Neurophysiol](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00387.2023)), the hippocampus ([Angeli et al., 2025 PNAS] (https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2422083122), and the thalamus ([Du et al., 2025 Neuron](https://doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2025.08.029)) and also within-individual TMS planning ([Sun et al., 2025 Hum Brain Mapp](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.70266)).



# Workflow
The code will work for functional MRI surface data on fsaverage6 surface space (nifti format). Contact us if there is any bug. Note that our code skip the group prior estimation step and directly use a pre-trained group prior DU15NET-prior. The code for external packages (MS-HBM) are NOT included here, but can be downloaded from [Thomas Yeo's Computational Brain Imaging Group](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG). 

use ./MSHBM/make-input-csv.sh to create sub_list.csv 
use ./MSHBM/run_MSHBM.sh to submit your job if you use a server
This pipeline will create maps using the color code /MSHBM/ColorMap_15.txt

# Related Resources
Parcellation Release: [DU15NET atlases](https://freesurfer.net/fswiki/CorticalParcellation_DU15NET) generated by this pipeline can be used in both group-averaging or individual-level studies. These atlases represent significant updates to previously available atlases, providing refinements that align with our current understanding of cortical organization.

Derived Maps: Network parcellation, temporal signal-to-noise ratio maps, and task contrast maps for all 15 participants (from [Du et al., 2024 J Neurophysiol](https://doi:10.1152/jn.00308.2023) are available [here](https://balsa.wustl.edu/study/zK166).
